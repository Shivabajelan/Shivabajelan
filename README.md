#  Hello and welcome to my GitHub page! 👋
My name is Shiva, and I'm delighted to share my journey with you. After exploring various fields, I have found my true passion in the world of data. Recently, I have been deeply immersed in this exciting field, expanding my knowledge by learning new tools and techniques such as Python, SQL, and Machine Learning. I was enrolled in University of Western Australia's Data Analytics Bootcamp, where I was gaining hands-on experience and building projects that showcase my skills. I'm continuosly improving my knowledge and skills in this field, and I cannot wait to see where this journey takes me. I'm excited to share my progress with you, and thank you for stopping by my page.
